## About Me

{{< figure class="avatar" src="img/avatar.jpg" >}}

I am a Senior Data Scientist at [Duo Security](https://www.duo.com), where I've worked since 2018. My current research involves the [detection of fraudulent authentications,](https://duo.com/docs/trust-monitor) as well as inflight detection of malicious activity via [risk-based authentication product](https://duo.com/docs/risk-based-auth).  

I attended the University of Michigan, where I obtained a B.S. in Computer Science. While there, I also studied physics and music, made a pretty cool [radiological measurement system](https://journals.lww.com/health-physics/Abstract/2018/11000/A_Radiation_Weather_Station__Development_of_a.6.aspx), and had the opportunity to teach [Computer Security](https://eecs388.org/).

In December 2021, I completed a Master's in [Computer Science and Data Science](https://cs.illinois.edu/academics/graduate/professional-mcs/online-master-computer-science-data-science) at the University of Illinois.

## Research Interests

My prior work is focused on using a combination of models for authentication anomaly detection. This work was presented at the [AI Village of DEFCON 29.](https://youtu.be/Kh9cKJGA5DM) Currently, I focus on identifying simple and powerful mechanisms for identifying malicious authentication behavior, without introducing undue friction for users. To see my latest public-facing work, see my [resume](https://beccalynch.com/resume/).

I'm also interested in the intersection of [data and privacy](https://beccalunch.substack.com/p/bereal-and-the-boiling-frog), as well as public policy and climate change. I am passionate about diversity and inclusion, and making our industry a [little less terrible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Te5ICgG1M78).
